Predicting Cancer with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model: Utilize the KNN algorithm to classify cancer cases as either malignant or benign. Train the model using relevant data, evaluate its performance, and use it to predict the nature of cancer based on features such as tumor size, cell shape, and other medical indicators.
